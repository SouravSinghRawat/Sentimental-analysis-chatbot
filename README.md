# Sentimental-analysis-chatbot

Project Summary: Sentiment-aware Chatbot with Llama and Sentiment Analysis

This project develops a chatbot that utilizes sentiment analysis to tailor its responses based on user emotions. By integrating the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model from Hugging Face, the chatbot detects sentiments—positive, negative, or neutral—and adjusts its replies accordingly. The Llama 2 model ensures coherent and natural language interactions. An interactive Gradio interface allows real-time user engagement, demonstrating the chatbot’s ability to enhance empathy and responsiveness in applications like customer support and mental health assistance.
